# bamazon
 Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront powered by Node and MySQL. For customers, the bamazon app takes in orders, calculates price, and depletes stock from the store's inventory.  For managers, the bamazon app views inventory, filters inventory by low stock, restocks, and adds new products.
